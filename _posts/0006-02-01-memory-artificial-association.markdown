(Pick a thing to learn/understand better if you didnâ€™t already)  
(Yeah, these instructions assume you have a bunch of memory game tiles available)

**Pick a random tile and look at the picture.**  
Think how whatever is on the tile is related  
to the thing you want to learn.  
Use your intuition, the connection can be anything:  
a feeling, a color, the shape, the way you use it or an abstract metaphor.  

**Repeat 4-8 times or for 5-10 minutes.**

When you're done, put the tiles back on the table face down.
