**Your brain is a vast network of probabilistic associations.**  
Some of these associations are more likely than others  
and manifest as concepts, habits and stories.  

To learn a thing, instead of just pouring information on your brain,  
**you can work with your memory and find ways to connect**  
**the new thing with the things you already know**
