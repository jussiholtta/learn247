Stand with your feet at your hip width,
in an alert but comfortable pose.
**Feel your body standing here, in this moment.**
You can close your eyes or let your gaze soften.

**Continue for 3-5 minutes.**

And when your mind wanders,
gently return to the sensations of your body standing **here
in this moment.**
