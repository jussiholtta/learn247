**You probably know what having an insight feels like.**
That sudden AHA! moment with a rush of energy.
Commonly happens when you are doing something else.
Your mind is quiet for a moment and then something just clicks.

**This mechanism is largely out of our control, but we know a lot about the conditions where it can happen.**
