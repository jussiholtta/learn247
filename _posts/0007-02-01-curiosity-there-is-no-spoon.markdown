When you were little, you spent all of your time learning.  
It took months to figure out how to pick up objects and  
when you did it opened a whole new world of learning.  
**Return to that day.**  

**Pick up one of the objects on the table like it was the first time ever.**  
Use your senses to explore it (please donâ€™t put it in your mouth)  
like you were seeing, feeling and hearing it for the very first time.  

**Continue this for 2-5 minutes.**  
And when your mind wanders, return to the direct sensory experience.
