Take a moment to settle in here and now.  
Listen to your body and mind.  
**Remember, whatever you are feeling**  
**is whatever you are already feeling right now.**  
You are simply tuning in to what's already here.  

Name 1-3 emotions and/or feelings that come up,  
and put them down on paper in whatever way or language you prefer.
